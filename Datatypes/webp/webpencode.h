/*
 * webp.datatype's encoder: 32-bit ARGB pixels to a lossless WebP file, by
 * libwebp's own lossless encoder (VP8LEncodeImage, BSD 3-clause with the
 * WebM patent grant), handed to the caller's writer a piece at a time.
 *
 * Lossless only: a picture saved and opened again is the same, pixel for
 * pixel, the colour under fully transparent pixels too ("exact"). Built
 * with libwebp-1.6.0-encoder-no-float.patch, so neither it nor the encoder
 * uses floating point (no FPU, no ROM math libraries), as the decoder.
